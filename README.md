This is a copy of a Python Django project written for AWS.   Lots of key information  such as keys have
been changed to 'blahdeblahdeblah', so it may be difficult to get working.   You could try using docker.

The following 3 environments need to be considered:
 - Local Development, on a Mac with MySQL installed
 - Test ElasticBeanstalk environment with access to a MySQL database
 - Production ElasticBeanstalk environment with access to a MySQL database.

 Please see the docs for more information.
